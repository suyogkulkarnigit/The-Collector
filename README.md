# Sentiment Collector

> The goal is to create a scraper that gathers social media data and processes it through a Hugging Face model to analyze sentiments and gain insights into how people perceive your profile. So far, very little work has been done, as Iâ€™m currently occupied with other tasks, but I plan to revisit it when I have more free time.
